    "A deque (double-ended queue) from the collections module might be chosen over a regular Python list to implement a queue because deques are designed specifically for efficient appending and popping from both ends. With a list, appending or popping from the beginning has a time complexity of O(n) because all the other elements need to be shifted, whereas with a deque, these operations are O(1) (constant time). This makes deques more efficient for operations that involve adding or removing elements from the beginning of the data structure, which is a common requirement for queues."

    "A real-world scenario where using a stack would be more practical than a list for data storage and retrieval is the undo/redo functionality in text editors or image editing software. When a user performs an action, like typing or applying a filter, the action can be pushed onto a stack. If the user wants to undo the action, the stack is popped, effectively reversing the previous action. Similarly, if the user wants to redo an action after undoing it, the popped action can be pushed back onto the stack. This last-in, first-out (LIFO) behavior of stacks makes them ideal for implementing undo/redo functionality, where the most recent actions need to be tracked and reversed in reverse order."
